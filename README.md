# Programming for Data Analysis Project

### Introduction
The point of this project is to analyse and simulate real-world data using Python, its package Numpy.random and Jupyter Notebooks.

### Description
-	Chose a Dataset based on a real-world phenomenon.
-	Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks model and clean the Dataset
-	Analyse the variables on this dataset and their distributions.
-	Based on this analysis, simulate, and synthesize a new dataset matching its proprieties.
-	Present the new dataset on a output cell and detail your research

## Getting Started 

### Setup

#### Prerequisites
To run this project locally you are going to need Python(and its packages: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy and MatplotLib) and Jupyter Notebook as well. You can gey both of Python and Jupyter by downloading [Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
You may need to install/update some of the Python's packages. You can do that by running the following commands:
Numpy 
'''pip install numpy'''

Pandas 
'''pip install pandas'''

Seaborn
'''pip install seaborn'''

MatPlotLib 
'''pip install matplotlib'''

Scypi
'''pip install matplotlib'''
